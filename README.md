# element-size-watch
A method for applying CSS classes and invoking a callback function by querying the size of HTML elements

## usage
```javascript
window.elementSizeWatch(document.querySelector(selector), options);
```
###### **_options_** parameter contents:
**_querySpec_** (OPTIONAL):
> A string specifying the tests to check for each time the element is resized. The format of the _querySpec_ is:

>'**[{min-, max-}]{width, height}:[0-9]+{px, %}[:className][:suppress], ...**' or  '*'

> and can be given as the content of an attribute of the element with name **data-size-watch**. If the '*' is used, then only the callback with be fired on each resize event.

**_callback_** (OPTIONAL):
> A function to call whenever the size of the watched element is found to match one of the tests in the _querySpec_. If the _querySpec_ is not provided and the _callback_ is a string, it is used as the _querySpec_.

**useAnimationFrame** (OPTIONAL, true by default):
> A boolean value indicating whether to make the relevant changes in an **_window.requestAnimationFrame_** callback or directly.

**allowQueryClasses** (OPTIONAL, true by default):
> A boolean value indicating whether to allow classes of the form, e.g., _width-100px_ or not, in case not alias has been provided.

###### workflow:

When the element is resized, each of the tests in the _querySpec_ is checked and if it succeeds, a descriptive class name of the form, e.g., _min-width-Npx_ is added to the class attribute of the element, unless the option parameter **allowQueryClasses** has the value **false**, and the callback, if it has been provided is executed with an object parameter of the form:
```
{
    element: the_element,
    elementSize: {
        width: the_width_of_the_element,
        height: the_height_of_the_element
    },
    classesRemoved: [ an_array_with_the_classes_removed ],
    classesAdded: [ an_array_with_the_classes_added ]
}
```
If the test does not succeed any class that had previously been added is removed from the class attribute of the element. If no such additions or deletions occur, the callback is not called. Finally, if _className_ had been given for a test, then this is the class name used in the class attribute of the element as well as the _classesRemoved_ and _classesAdded_ arrays of the object passed to the callback. Additionally, for each test in the _querySpec_, if it ends with _:suppress_, then the class addition that would occur if the test was true, even if _className_ has been provided, will not happen. Finally, if it ends with _:clear_, then the class specified is removed from the element, if the test is successful.
